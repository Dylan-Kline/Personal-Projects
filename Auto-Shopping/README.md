# Auto Shop Bot
Mini project that uses a python selenium webdriver to navigate a website to find and add items to the cart.

Motivation:

This project was mainly motivated by the desire to not miss out on a limited keycap set after extras came into-stock. In addition I wanted to apply myself in a programming project outside of school.

Reflection:

Learning how to plan out and design a self-created program was interesting. Instead of following pre-set requirements, I had to think deeper into what functions I would need, and how I could make the program interchangable for other websites if warrented. I certainly learned quite a bit about the basics of working with a webdriver. Though this program hasn't got to see action yet, the extras for the keycaps have never came out :(.
