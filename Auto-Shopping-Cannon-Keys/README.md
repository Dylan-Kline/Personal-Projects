Mini project that uses a python selenium webdriver to navigate a website to find and add items to the cart.

Motivation:

This project was mainly motivated by the desire to not miss out on a limited keycap set after extras came in-stock. In addition to applying myself in a programming project outside of school.

Reflection:

Learning how to plan out and design a self-created program was interesting. Instead of following pre-set requirements, I had to think deeper into what functions I would need, and how I could make the program interchangable for other websites if needed. I certainly learned quite a bit about the basics of the inner working of a webdriver through this project. Though the extras for the keycaps have never came out :(.
